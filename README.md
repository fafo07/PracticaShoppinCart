# PracticaShoppinCart
For use the REST API you will need the deafult user. The credentials are:
                                    username: Fafo7
                                    password: 1234
For used more easy, I added to attributes for schemas user and product, these are idUser and idProduct.
In the shoppingcart in the method post, you need to send in the body: username, idProduct, quantity. And in the methods delete and post for pay you will must send only the username.
